# Confusing-Maze

This project involves a random maze generation. The maze behaves in a way so that whenever you make a step in the maze it changes completely. The maze is pregenerated in the beginning of each game. 
There is a green circle on the ground indicating the next step to take to solve the maze. The exit is at random location in every run.
