# Confusing-Maze


## Goal
This project involves a random maze generation. The maze behaves in a way so that whenever you make a step in the maze it changes completely. Meaning, the walls in the maze appear and disapear around the player. The maze is pregenerated in the beginning of each game. 
There is a **green circle** on the ground that indicates the next step to take to solve the maze. The exit is at a random location on every run.

### Involves implementation of the following:
  - Prim's algorithm for maze generation
  - BFS shortest pathfinding alg through a 3d random space
  
This project is done in the setting of COMP521 class at McGill University. All the credit for coming up with this project goes to Professor [Clark Verbrugge](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/~clump/).
