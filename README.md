# Confusing-Maze

(Warning)
This is still work in progress, the code requires some cleaning.

This project involves a random maze generation. The maze behaves in a way so that whenever you make a step in the maze it changes completely. The walls in the maze appear and disapear around the player. The maze is pregenerated in the beginning of each game. 

There is a **green circle** on the ground indicating the next step to take to solve the maze. The exit is at random location in every run.

# Involves implementation of the following:
  - Prim's algorithm for maze generation
  - BFS shortest pathfinding alg through a 3d random space
